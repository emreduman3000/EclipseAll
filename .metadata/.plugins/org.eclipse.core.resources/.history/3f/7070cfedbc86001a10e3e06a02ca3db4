			  1-PRIMITIVE DATA TYPES
			  		
				1a.)There are 8 primitive data types in Java:
				
					Data Type	Size		Description
					byte		1 byte		Stores whole numbers from -128 to 127
					short		2 bytes		Stores whole numbers from -32,768 to 32,767
					int			4 bytes		Stores whole numbers from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
					long		8 bytes		Stores whole numbers from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
					float		4 bytes		Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 6 to 7 decimal digits
					double		8 bytes		Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 15 decimal digits
					boolean		1 bit		Stores true or false values
					char		2 bytes		Stores a single character/letter or ASCII values
				
				1b.)Numbers
				
					Primitive number types are divided into 2 groups:
					
					* Integer types stores  without decimals. Valid types are byte, short, int and long. 			
					* Floating point types represents numbers with a fractional part, containing one or more decimals. There are two types: float and double.
						
			2-NON-PRIMITIVE DATA TYPES
			
				Non-primitive data types are called reference types because they refer to objects.
				
				The main difference between primitive and non-primitive data types are:
				
				* Primitive types are predefined (already defined) in Java. Non-primitive types are created by the programmer 
				  and is not defined by Java (except for String).
				  
				* Non-primitive types can be used to call methods to perform certain operations, while primitive types cannot.
				
				* A primitive type has always a value, while non-primitive types can be null.
				* A primitive type starts with a lowercase letter, while non-primitive types starts with an uppercase letter.
				* The size of a primitive type depends on the data type, while non-primitive types have all the same size.
				* Examples of non-primitive types are Strings, Arrays, Classes, Interface, etc. You will learn more about these in a later chapter.
